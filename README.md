# Enigma App
Hello! This is my own implementation of the [Enigma Machine](https://www.ciphermachinesandcryptology.com/en/enigmatech.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20reflector%2C%20the%20connections,same%20machine%20setting%20and%20wiring.).

The app was developed in Java and JavaFX GUI

The following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlN8XOgdVLtGt53iKidWxbSQqk343XwBz) is a collection of sources I referenced to develop the project.
